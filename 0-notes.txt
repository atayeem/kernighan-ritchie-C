 a char can be signed???

basic data:
char, int, float, double
prefixes:
short, long, signed, unsigned

getchar gets the next character
putchar prints a character

function parameters are not constant. you can modify them.
like you could
void bruh(int c)
{
    c++;
}

if it's an array, because the pointer to the array is passed in, the array itself can be modified
this applies to any pointer passed to a function (like scanf(&s))

'c' != "c" since one is an int and the other is an array
